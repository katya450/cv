			<div id="aboutme" class="aboutme-class">
        		<p>I have several years of experience of working with different systems and applications as well as multiple projects. 
				For the past years I have been working with complex environments doing systems integration. 
				I also have experience from the business side doing acceptance testing and requirement specification and working between the client and the IT-supplier. 
       			</p><p>
				I have keen interest in programming and automation, and would like to put my junior-level programming skills in use and improve them to become an independent developer. After I graduated, I have spent some of my non-office time learning and re-learning Java, ReactJS, NodeJS and Robot test automation, to mention a few.
				</p><p>
				I take my responsibilities seriously and I don't mouse around when there are things to be done. I mostly enjoy working in a good and fun team, yet I'm not afraid of independent responsibilities either. I've been told that I bring a personal touch and positive atmosphere to a team I work with.
				I'm a native Finnish speaker, but I get along fine in English. 
				</p><p>
				During my career I've had plenty of thanks from my positive attitude. My current and my previous boss as well as many of my colleagues have promised to recommend me.

					You can't know a person just by knowing their work and education history, or future plans on those areas.
					Being a pretty(/too) open person myself, I'll share some light about what I like to do on my off-duty time.
					<br/><br/>
					Occasionally I hear the saying that motorbikes are not just a hobby, they're a way of life. 
					With my old bikes that is very true. They would take all my time and money if only I let it happen. 
					I have a Harley-Davidson Sportster 883 from 1988 and a Honda CB450 from 1970. I tend to create some kind of an emotional connection to my combustion engine machines, and 
					<br/><br/>
					In addition to combustion engines I love all handicrafts and especially yarns. 
					Autumn evenings are perfect for crocheting and knitting. I also sew some of my clothes.
					<br/><br/>
					Music makes me happy. But not just any music, but mainly extreme metal, punk or psychobilly. 
					I often go to see bands live, because the music is just best that way.
					When I got the time - sadly not enough lately - I also volunteer for ELMU (live music organization in Helsinki) because I want to support what they do.
				<br/><br/>
					Too big a part of my free time however is spent in another worlds. 
					Computer games are my old and dear hobby, which has gained me a few real life friends as well. At the time I'm addicted to turn-based roleplaying games, like Divinity.
